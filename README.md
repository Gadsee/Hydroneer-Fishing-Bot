# Hydroneer Fish Bot

OpenCV 2 based fishing bot for Hydroneer.
Looks for the biggest red area on the screen (since the bobber is red) and clicks if the
downwards Y-movement is too big.

Press Q in the bot vision menu to exit. May not work on setups where the left-most
monitor is not the primary one, in which case adjust the screenshot pixels yourself.
